# Project Title
Google Homepage
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).


## Description

This is my first HTML/CSS project. It consisted in creating a webpage that would look like the google.com homepage.

The dropdown menus, form submissions, and hover-highlighting were to be ignored. I however chose to add the hover-highlighting effects.


## What I learnt (main takeaways)
	- How to center a div with the use of the transform property.
	- How to center elements in a div with the position: absolute declaration.
	- How to make a footer stick to the bottom of the page.
	- How to use the float property.
	- How to use Dev tools to identify, for example, the background color of a button.
	- How to use classes.
	- How to create a basic form.




## Built With the Help of
Atom 1.24.0
Chrome and Mozilla Dev tools were used to identify some font sizes, colors, etc.
