# Project Title
Google Homepage
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).


## Description

This is my first HTML/CSS project. It consisted in creating a webpage that would look like the google.com homepage.

The dropdown menus, form submissions, and hover-highlighting were to be ignored. I however chose to add the hover-highlighting effects.


## What I learnt (main takeaways)
	- How to center a div.
	In a previous version, I used the `transform` property.
	In the newest version, I simplified my code: Instead of using the `transform` and `absolute` properties, I used `margin: 0 auto;` to center the div horizontally, `text-align: center;` to center the elements in the div.

	- How to make a footer stick to the bottom of the page.

	- How to use the `float` property.

	- How to use Dev tools to identify, for example, the background color of a button.

	- How to use Dev tools to debug our own code.

	- How to use classes.

	- How to create a basic form.




## Built With the Help of
Atom 1.24.0
Chrome and Mozilla Dev tools were used to identify some font sizes, colors, etc.
